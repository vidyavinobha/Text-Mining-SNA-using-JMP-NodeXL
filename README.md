# Text-Mining-SNA-using-JMP-NodeXL
This presentation outlines the project work done by my team and I as a part of the course 'Aligning Information Systems and Business Strategies'
The movie script for "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone" was analysed to find the subthemes, character clusters and thematic emotions.
Social network analysis of the characters was conducted to find the central character cluster using NodeXL.
Text analytics was conducted on the script using SAS JMP to find the major sub-themes of the movie.
Sentiment analysis using JMP helped deduce the sentiment change towards a pivotal character in the movie.
Music analytics and Gender analytics were also conducted on a small scale to understand the sub theme emotions and character gender diversity.
